# Tic_tac_toe
The Tic_tac_toe project is a game built with ruby. It is a game you get to play and have fun with ease.It has the setting file where the board is. We also have the Game_Logic that contains the logic of the game as the name says.

## Game Instruction

As the gif shows in this game there are two signs x and o by which it is played. Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game
You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
